# Fake-News-Detection
### News claims are precise in express the main meaning of the main articles. However, not all news claims are correct. 
### We used NLP tools to compare the news claims to the relavant news articles, in order to correctly identify the correct news claims.
#### Two machine learning models are developped for this use case, namely logistic regression (LR) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).
